                                    sersnoop

what?

   a simple command-line tool for linux that echoes bytes to and from any
   two serial ports, ptys, or network sockets, and prints all traffic to
   stdout, in hex and ascii.

why?

   i needed a tool to redirect programs that only understand serial ports
   (or pty's) to communicate over the network instead (to a terminal
   server). then i discovered bugs in the serial communications. i needed
   to debug what was going on over the serial port, using a pty.
   therefore, i needed a way to display hex dumps, and also to optionally
   connect the serial port to a pty and/or network socket. and it just
   kind of went from there...

status

     alpha. it works swimmingly well on linux, but needs cleanups and
   portability. [screenshot.png]

  to install (binary, debian):

     get [1]the latest x86 .deb file and dpkg -i the thing.

  to install (from source):

     you'll need linux. the code uses non-portable linux-isms in the
   network socket code. this is fixable, but i haven't done it yet. for
   now, it's a penguin-only thing.

     get the [2]source and untar it.

     get my [3]utility header file and put it either in the source tree or
   somewhere else in your include path

     type "make". hopefully it will build for you ;-)

     "./sersnoop -h" will get you the help. you can specify two fd's to
   listen to: -a and -b. either or both of these can be a network socket,
   a physical tty, or a virtual pty.

     or, on debian systems, to build from source, you can grab the
   [4]source package files and build from them.

  bugs

     it only works on linux

  to do

     daemon mode without all the byte-decode display output

     make the network socket code portable

     autoconf

     re-accept() a socket after it dies. this may require callbacks or
   other goofy things.

     get the debian source package squared away, it's missing the header

  licensing

   GPL.
