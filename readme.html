<h3>what?</h3>
a simple command-line tool for linux that echoes bytes to and from any two serial ports, ptys, or network sockets, and prints all traffic to stdout, in hex and ascii.

<h3>why?</h3>
i needed a tool to redirect programs that only understand serial ports (or pty's) to communicate over the network instead (to a terminal server). then i discovered bugs in the serial communications. i needed to debug what was going on over the serial port, using a pty. therefore, i needed a way to display hex dumps, and also to optionally connect the serial port to a pty and/or network socket. and it just kind of went from there...

<h3>status</h3>
<li>alpha. it works swimmingly well on linux, but needs cleanups and portability.

<h3>to install (binary, debian): </h3>
<li>get <a href=src/sersnoop_current_i386.deb>the latest x86 .deb file</a> and dpkg -i the thing.

<h3>to install (from source): </h3>
<li>you'll need linux. the code uses non-portable linux-isms in the network socket code. this is fixable, but i haven't done it yet. for now, it's a penguin-only thing.
<li>get the <a href="src/sersnoop-current.tar.gz">source</a> and untar it.
<li>get my <a href="src/kenmacros.h">utility header file</a> and put it either in the source tree or somewhere else in your include path
<li>type "make". hopefully it will build for you ;-)
<li>"./sersnoop -h" will get you the help. you can specify two fd's to listen to: -a and -b. either or both of these can be a network socket, a physical tty, or a virtual pty.
<li>or, on debian systems, to build from source, you can grab the <a href=src>source package files</a> and build from them.

<h3>bugs</h3>
<li>it only works on linux

<h3>to do</h3>
<li>daemon mode without all the byte-decode display output
<li>make the network socket code portable
<li>autoconf 
<li>re-accept() a socket after it dies. this may require callbacks or
other goofy things.
<li>get the debian source package squared away, it's missing the header

<h3>licensing</h3>
GPL.
